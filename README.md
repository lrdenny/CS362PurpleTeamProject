# CS 362 Purple Team Project

## Overview
This project was developed for the CS 362 (Spring 2021) course at Eastern Oregon University by "Purple Team" to simulate a basic web application that can work with a database to track the "spread" of COVID-19 in the city of La Grande, OR. This is accomplished using the Flask web framework, as well as sqlite and SQLAlchemy for the database.
